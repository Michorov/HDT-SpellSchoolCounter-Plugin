# HDT-SpellSchoolCounter-Plugin

This is a simple plugin that will show you what spell schools you've played when you hover over a cards that are affected by the number of spell schools you've played this match.

There are a lot of things that are imperfect about this extension but it works. I hope to improve on it some day but I was really just doing this as a quick starter project to get involved with contributing to HDT.
